Old future ideas




Future Ideas
Super Modes
- Hit left saucer to lite a mode (second time around, captive ball hit to qualify saucer to qualify mode to reduce play time). Switch hits change lit mode. Hit the top saucer to begin a mode. Where relevant, activate a timer where switch hits freeze timer. Score big points on lit feature. Collect huge bonus points at left saucer to end mode/grace-period after mode over and to lit next mode

 1) Super spinner = Stern Meteor spinner mixed with Iron Maiden Fear of the Dark - Big increase for spinner base value. Each drop target down increases spinner base value. Spinner value resets on 6 bank completion. Captive ball hits award multiplier. Left saucer resets drops to keep increasing value and maybe locks in a base value? Limited number of rips? Timed? Bonus points for landing in top saucer (extra time or rips?)

 2) Super captive ball = Hit captive ball for big points. Each drop target down increase captive ball value. Bank completions add multiplier. Left inlane activates temporary large multiplier to encourage fast play.

 3) Super drops = drop targets and pop high in value. Bank completions add multiplier. Captive ball hits increase base value

 4) Super plunge = kill the flippers to drain the ball. How many times can the player succesfuly plunge into the saucer? Extra points for not hitting top rebound switches. Mode ends when any other switches are hit. Ball drains. Ball is served back to player to continue play. Extra bonus in left saucer on countdown.

 5) Super slings (?) = insane points on slingshots of death. Short ball save based on number of sling hits per second to encourage hitting the slings.

 6) Super saucer (?) = Countdown points to hit saucer. Hitting it rewards the points, resets countdown and for higher value. Cap number of completions?

 7) Moving spot drop target challenge (?) - reset alll drops - hit the moving lit drop target. Misses dont reset. Lasts until all drops are down and no more targets to hit. Bonuses for perfect hits and a perfect finish. Should pop be disabled/weakened to promote accurate play? (Need clear drops with additional lights for this). Sharpshooter variation? Flipper buttons move lit target

 8) Super inlanes (?) - Complete inlanes. Shatzing mode. (Need additional inlane lights for this)

 9) Around the playfield - hit set order of shots around the game. Maybe randomize, but probably better to have logical flow or psuedo-random. Countdown timer

 10) Super Duper Spinner rip - single rip, number of rotations = %of score to be added to current score

 Super Wizard Mode = Awarded for completing all super modes. Switch frenzy. Huge points for everything. Timed mode with no additional time but free ball save to encourage play.

other

Captive ball multiball idea
- install disapearing post at entrance and behind switch.
- no balls locked
    - hitting rollover brings up post at bottom. one ball has now been locked
        - hitting captured ball past roll over scores points
        - hitting captured ball to stand up raises post after switch
            - one ball now locked in midway position
                - hitting stand up increases jackpot value
                - hitting roll over switch locks next ball (change to mid captive ball hits standup for difficulty later)
                    - two ball now locked
                        -hit lower captured ball to hit upper captured ball to hit standup to release 2 locked balls for 3 ball MB
    - hitting standup brings up middle post
            - one ball now locked in midway position
            - hitting roll over switch locks next ball

 - variations
 - 2 MB, 3MB skill for lower level difficulty
    - no balls
        - lock a ball in lower position. hitting roll over or standup raises lower post
        - hitting captive ball to rollver lowers post to start 2 ball multiball
        - hitting standup with 1 ball locked will lower post and 1 additional ball will be autolaunched into play for 3 ball play
    - ball in middle
        - should this just auto drop at the end of a players ball to lower back down? Out of playfield entirely? Relased to player to play but cannot lock any more balls on that ball? (timed bonus ball? or timed bonus 2 ball multiball???)
        - Maybe stay up in player has virtual lock on previous ball in a multiball
        - hitting it to standup starts 3 ball multiball
        - hitting roll over but not standup brings up lower post

with the use of one way and control gates in the shooter lane, it may be possible to skillfully plunge balls into the captive ball area. Futher this could allow the game to load balls into the captive ball area for modes, random rewards, and competitive balance
